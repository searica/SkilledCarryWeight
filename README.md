**Server-Side Info**: This mod does work as a client-side only mod and only needs to be installed on the server if you wish to enforce configuration settings.

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there and skip to step 3 below. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim (BepInEx) and the Jotunn plugin installed.

## Configuration
Changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (no restart required) and they will also sync to clients if the mod is on the server. The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager (changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

### Global Section Configuration:

**Verbosity**
- Low will log basic information about the mod. Medium will log information that is useful for troubleshooting. High will log a lot of information, do not set it to this without good reason as it will slow down your game.
  - Acceptable values: Low, Medium, High
  - Default value: Low.
